# Node.js Project

## Overview
This project is a template for creating a Node.js application with MySQL database connection. It sets up a basic project structure with directories for routes, SQL queries, and database connection. The project uses Express for the web server and MySQL for database operations.

## Use Case
This project template is suitable for building various types of web applications using Node.js and MySQL. Here's a typical use case:

### Use Case: Building a User Management System
Suppose you need to develop a user management system for a web application. You can use this project template as a starting point. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Set Up the Project**: Clone or fork this repository to start your project. Run the `create-node-project.sh` script to create a new Node.js project based on this template.

2. **Define Routes**: Define routes for user authentication, user registration, user profile management, etc., in the `src/routes` directory.

3. **Write SQL Queries**: Define SQL queries for CRUD operations on user data in the `src/query` directory. For example, you can create queries for fetching user data, inserting new users, updating user information, and deleting users.

4. **Establish Database Connection**: Configure your database connection details in the `config/index.js` file. The `src/db/connection.js` file establishes a connection to the MySQL database using these configuration settings.

5. **Implement Business Logic**: Write business logic for user authentication, registration, profile management, etc., in your route handlers. Utilize the SQL queries defined in the `src/query` directory to interact with the database.

6. **Run the Server**: Run the server using `npm start` command. Your Node.js application will start listening on the specified port, and you can access your routes via HTTP requests.

7. **Test and Deploy**: Test your application thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements. Once tested, deploy your application to a production environment for real-world usage.
